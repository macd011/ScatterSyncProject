# ScatterSync

ScatterSync is a cross-platform productivity app built using **React Native** and **Expo**, designed with accessibility in mind for **adults with ADHD**. The app combines task management, focus-based timing techniques, and calendar scheduling into a distraction-free interface. This project was developed as part of a final-year research-based software engineering project.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Task Management** – Create, complete, and organise daily tasks with deadlines and visual filters.
- **Pomodoro-style Focus Timer** – Time-box work into focus sessions with visual countdowns and reminders.
- **Daily Scheduler** – Plan your day visually with an hour-by-hour breakdown and real-time markers.
- **Productivity Tracking** – Maintain usage streaks and view a visual graph of your engagement.
- **Minimal UX** – A clean, user-friendly interface tailored to reduce cognitive load.

## 📚 Project Summary

ScatterSync was created to explore how digital tools can support executive dysfunction—particularly time blindness and working memory deficits—experienced by individuals with ADHD. The application integrates evidence-based productivity strategies (e.g., visual timers, streak reinforcement, simplified UI design) based on academic research and user-experience principles for neurodivergent users.

The app uses **Firebase** for authentication and secure, user-specific data storage with real-time updates. Development followed an agile, sprint-based methodology, focusing on iterative feature releases and modular, scalable code.
